  "content": "# 5 Essential Emergency Plumbing Tips Every Sydney Homeowner Should Know\n\nPlumbing emergencies can strike at any time, and knowing how to respond can mean the difference between a minor inconvenience and major property damage. As Sydney's trusted emergency plumbers, we've seen firsthand how quick thinking can save homeowners thousands of dollars.\n\n## 1. Know Where Your Main Water Shut-Off Valve Is\n\nThe single most important thing you can do to prepare for a plumbing emergency is to locate your main water shut-off valve **before** disaster strikes. In most Sydney homes, you'll find it:\n\n- Near your water meter (usually at the front of your property)\n- In the garage or laundry\n- Under the kitchen sink (in some older homes)\n\nMake sure everyone in your household knows where it is and how to turn it off.\n\n## 2. What to Do When a Pipe Bursts\n\nA burst pipe can release hundreds of litres of water per hour. Here's your action plan:\n\n1. **Turn off the main water supply immediately**\n2. Switch off your hot water system\n3. Open all taps to drain remaining water\n4. Turn off electricity in affected areas\n5. Call an emergency plumber right away\n\n## 3. Handling a Blocked Drain\n\nWhile some blockages can wait, others are emergencies. Call immediately if you notice:\n\n- Multiple drains backing up simultaneously\n- Sewage odours coming from drains\n- Water backing up in the toilet or shower\n- Gurgling sounds from multiple fixtures\n\nAvoid using chemical drain cleaners - they can damage your pipes and make the problem worse.\n\n## 4. Gas Leak Safety\n\nIf you smell gas (that distinctive rotten egg odour), treat it as an emergency:\n\n- **Don't** turn any electrical switches on or off\n- **Don't** use your phone inside the house\n- Open windows and doors\n- Turn off the gas meter if safe to do so\n- Leave the property immediately\n- Call 131 909 (AGL) or your gas provider, then a licensed gas fitter\n\n## 5. When to Call an Emergency Plumber\n\nNot every plumbing issue is an emergency. Here's when you need 24/7 help:\n\n- No water supply\n- Burst or severely leaking pipes\n- Sewage backup\n- Gas leaks\n- Hot water system failures (especially in cold weather)\n- Major toilet blockages\n\n## Why Choose Sydney Elite Plumbing for Emergencies?\n\nWhen plumbing disasters strike, you need a team you can trust.
